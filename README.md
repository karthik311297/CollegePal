# CollegePal

The main aim of this app is to provide a central platform where a college student can access data related to the various clubs,groups working on startups,events going on in the college campus.
He/she can look up the details of the club/group incharge.
Also the app has a platform where a student can look what all projects(uploaded to github) have been done by the students around. The contact information of the project creator can also be viewed based on one's interest.
Finally a student can send request to admin for permission to conduct an event,the admin may then approve/disapprove the event based on venue availablity
